## Post-War Paranoia

The First Red Scare was a period of intense anti-communist and anti-anarchist sentiment in the United States following World War I. This period saw widespread fear of Bolshevik revolution and radical political movements.

## Palmer Raids

Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducted a series of raids against suspected radicals and anarchists. These raids, carried out in 1919 and 1920, resulted in:

- Mass arrests of suspected radicals
- Deportation of hundreds of immigrants
- Violations of civil liberties
- Suppression of leftist political organizations

## Impact on Civil Liberties

The Red Scare led to:

- Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly
- Workplace loyalty tests
- Increased surveillance of political activists
- Xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants

## Legacy

The First Red Scare set precedents for later periods of political repression, including the Second Red Scare of the 1950s (McCarthyism). It demonstrated how fear and national security concerns could be used to justify curtailing civil liberties.
