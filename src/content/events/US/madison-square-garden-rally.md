## A Nazi Rally in America

On February 20, 1939, the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi organization, held a massive rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. More than 20,000 attendees filled the arena in one of the most disturbing displays of Nazi sympathy on American soil.

## The Event

The rally featured:

- A massive portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas
- Speakers promoting Nazi ideology and anti-Semitism
- Uniformed members of the Bund's "Ordnungsdienst" (Order Division)
- Banners declaring "Stop Jewish Domination of Christian America"

## Organization

The German American Bund, led by Fritz Kuhn, was:

- Modeled after Hitler's Nazi Party
- Active in major American cities with significant German immigrant populations
- Operating youth camps that mimicked Hitler Youth programs
- Publishing pro-Nazi propaganda in English and German

## Opposition and Protests

The rally faced significant opposition:

- Over 100,000 anti-Nazi protesters gathered outside
- Heavy police presence (1,700 officers) to prevent violence
- Jewish War Veterans and other groups organized counter-protests
- The event drew widespread condemnation from political leaders

## Aftermath

Following the rally:

- Public outrage intensified
- The Bund came under increased government scrutiny
- Fritz Kuhn was later imprisoned for embezzlement
- With the outbreak of World War II, the organization collapsed
- The event remains a stark reminder of fascist movements in America

## Historical Context

- Hitler had already annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia
- The world was on the brink of World War II
