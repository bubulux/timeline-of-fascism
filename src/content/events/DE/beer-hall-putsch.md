## The Failed Coup

In November 1923, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party attempted to seize power in Munich through a coup d'état known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The attempted insurrection took place at the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich.

## Key Events

Hitler, along with World War I general Erich Ludendorff and other Nazi leaders, attempted to:

- Take Bavarian government officials hostage
- March on Berlin to overthrow the Weimar government
- Establish a new nationalist government

## Outcome

The putsch was quickly suppressed by police and military forces. Hitler was arrested and tried for treason. During his subsequent imprisonment, he wrote "Mein Kampf," outlining his political ideology and future plans.

### Impact

Though a failure at the time, the Beer Hall Putsch gave Hitler national attention and transformed his strategy from violent revolution to gaining power through legal, democratic means—a strategy that would ultimately prove successful.
