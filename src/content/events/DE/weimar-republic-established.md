## Overview

Following Germany's defeat in World War I and the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Weimar Republic was established as Germany's first democratic government. The republic faced immediate challenges including economic hardship, political instability, and the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

## Political Context

The new democratic government was born in crisis. The republic had to navigate:

- War reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles
- Hyperinflation that devastated the German economy
- Political extremism from both the left and right
- Loss of territory and national humiliation

## Legacy

The Weimar Republic, despite its democratic ideals, would prove fragile. Its weaknesses and the crises it faced would ultimately pave the way for the rise of extremist movements in Germany.
