## A Fateful Appointment

On January 30, 1933, German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. This appointment marked a turning point in German and world history, setting in motion events that would lead to World War II and the Holocaust.

## Political Maneuvering

The appointment came after months of political instability and backroom negotiations. Conservative politicians believed they could control Hitler and use his popularity to their advantage. Franz von Papen, a former chancellor, reportedly told a friend: "We have hired him."

### Key Factors

Several factors led to Hitler's appointment:

- The Nazi Party had become the largest party in the Reichstag
- Economic depression and political instability created fertile ground for extremism
- Conservative elites believed they could manipulate Hitler
- President Hindenburg, despite his reservations, was convinced to make the appointment

## Immediate Aftermath

Hitler moved quickly to consolidate power:

1. Called for new elections in March 1933
2. Used the Reichstag Fire as pretext for emergency powers
3. Passed the Enabling Act, effectively ending democracy
4. Eliminated political opposition

## Historical Significance

This event demonstrated how democratic systems can be vulnerable to authoritarian takeover. Hitler's legal path to power—through elections and constitutional appointments—would be studied as a cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy.
